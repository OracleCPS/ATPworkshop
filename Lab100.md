# Lab 100: Spinning up ATP and OIC prerequisites

[Download SQL Developer](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html)

You will need SQL Developer to load and view data into your ATP database. If you are having connectivity issues, make sure you are not on a VPN. 

[Provisioning an Autonomous Database](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/workshops/autonomous-transaction-processing/?page=LabGuide100ProvisionAnATPDatabase.md)

This lab explains how to spin up an Autonomous Database and acquire your own Cloud Wallet. 

[Downloading the Cloud Wallet and connecting to your database](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/workshops/autonomous-transaction-processing/?page=LabGuide200SecureConnectivityAndDataAccess.md)

You will need the cloud wallet in order to connect your database on OIC. You will also need to connect your database to SQL Developer in order to run the SQL demands in the "Notes for instructors" section below. This lab explains how to do those actions. 

[Introduction to Oracle Integration Cloud](https://github.com/KseniiaRyuma/HCM_to_EBS_integration/blob/master/oic100.md)

This lab walks through how to spin up an OIC instance and other basics. It also goes through another use case. For this lab you can stop after you spin up OIC and arrive at the home page.

This short tutorial explains how to create a generic REST adapter in OIC. You will need this adapter in lab 200. 

## Notes for instructors

### **STEP 1**: These tables need to be created within the ATP instance

Copy the commands below and run them in SQL Developer when connected to the ATP database. 

```
CREATE TABLE Market (
   id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS as IDENTITY(START with 1 INCREMENT by 1),
   name VARCHAR2(255),
   client VARCHAR2(255),
   zipcode VARCHAR2(255),
   salesrepname VARCHAR2(255),
   salesrepemail VARCHAR2(255)
);
```
```
CREATE TABLE Opportunity (
   id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS as IDENTITY(START with 1 INCREMENT by 1),
   name VARCHAR2(255),
   client VARCHAR2(255),
   region VARCHAR2(255),
   country VARCHAR2(255),
   state VARCHAR2(255),
   city VARCHAR2(255),
   Address VARCHAR2(255),
   zipcode VARCHAR2(255),
   timeentered VARCHAR2(255)
);
```

### **STEP 2**: The Market table is going to need one value inserted, with a zipcode of 12345. 

```
INSERT INTO MARKET (name, client, zipcode, salesrepname, salesrepemail) VALUES (
'Market A', 'Client A', '12345', 'Robert Spaulding', 'robert.spaulding@website.com');
```

### **STEP 3**: The database will need the following stored procedure created: 
```
create or replace PROCEDURE GET_MARKET
(
   p_zipcode IN VARCHAR2,
   p_clientName OUT VARCHAR2,
   p_marketName OUT VARCHAR2,
   p_salesRepName OUT VARCHAR2,
   p_salesRepEmail OUT VARCHAR2
)
AS
BEGIN
   SELECT name, client, salesRepName, salesRepEmail INTO p_marketName, p_clientName, p_salesRepName, p_salesRepEmail FROM Market WHERE Market.zipcode = p_zipcode;
END;
```
